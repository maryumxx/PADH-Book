# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

Welcome to Module 2! In this module, you'll learn how to create realistic digital twins of robotic systems using physics simulation and high-fidelity rendering.

## What You'll Learn

In this module, we'll explore the essential tools and techniques for building digital twins - virtual replicas of physical robotic systems that enable testing, visualization, and development before deploying to real hardware.

- **Chapter 1**: Simulating physics, gravity, and collisions in Gazebo
- **Chapter 2**: Building simulation environments and worlds
- **Chapter 3**: High-fidelity rendering and human-robot interaction in Unity
- **Chapter 4**: Simulating sensors (LiDAR, Depth Cameras, IMUs)

## Prerequisites

Before starting Module 2, you should have completed **Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System** and understand:

- ROS 2 fundamentals (nodes, topics, services)
- URDF robot descriptions
- Basic ROS 2 command-line tools (`ros2 run`, `ros2 topic`, etc.)
- Python basics for ROS 2 development

## Why Digital Twins Matter

Digital twins are revolutionizing robotics development by allowing engineers to:

- **Test Safely**: Validate algorithms in simulation before deploying to expensive hardware
- **Iterate Quickly**: Make changes and see results instantly without physical setup time
- **Scale Development**: Run multiple simulations in parallel to test edge cases
- **Visualize Complex Data**: See sensor data and robot behavior in immersive 3D environments
- **Train AI**: Generate synthetic data for machine learning without manual data collection

By mastering Gazebo and Unity, you'll be able to create digital twins that bridge the gap between software development and physical robotics.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Set up Gazebo simulations with realistic physics properties
- Configure gravity, friction, and collision detection for robotic systems
- Build custom simulation environments with models, lighting, and terrain
- Integrate Unity for photorealistic rendering and user interfaces
- Simulate and visualize LiDAR, depth cameras, and IMUs
- Connect simulation environments to ROS 2 systems for end-to-end testing
- Understand the strengths and use cases of Gazebo vs. Unity in robotics

## Module Structure

### Chapter 1: Simulating Physics, Gravity, and Collisions in Gazebo

Learn the fundamentals of physics simulation in Gazebo, including physics engines (ODE, Bullet, Simbody), gravity configuration, friction models, and collision detection. You'll understand how Gazebo calculates realistic robot dynamics and interactions with the environment.

### Chapter 2: Building Simulation Environments

Discover how to create custom simulation worlds, spawn models, configure lighting, and design realistic testing environments. You'll learn world file structure, SDF format, and techniques for building everything from simple test rooms to complex outdoor terrains.

### Chapter 3: High-Fidelity Rendering and Human-Robot Interaction in Unity

Explore Unity's role in robotics for creating visually stunning simulations and interactive user interfaces. You'll learn the Unity Robotics Hub, ROS-Unity bridge, rendering pipelines (URP, HDRP), and patterns for human-robot interaction.

### Chapter 4: Simulating Sensors: LiDAR, Depth Cameras, and IMUs

Master sensor simulation for perception systems. You'll configure LiDAR (point clouds), depth cameras (RGBD data), and IMUs (accelerometer/gyroscope), integrate them with ROS topics, and visualize sensor data in RViz.

## Software Versions

This module uses the following software versions:

- **Gazebo Classic**: 9.x - 11.x (with notes on migration to Gazebo Sim/Ignition)
- **Unity**: 2021.3 LTS or later
- **Unity Robotics Hub**: Latest release
- **ROS 2**: Humble Hawksbill or later
- **Ubuntu**: 20.04 or 22.04

Where version-specific differences exist, we'll provide callouts and migration guidance.
