# Welcome to Physical AI Documentation

Welcome to the comprehensive guide to **Physical AI** – the intersection of robotics, artificial intelligence, and physical systems. This book is designed to help you master the fundamental concepts and practical skills needed to build intelligent robotic systems.

## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that interact with and operate in the physical world. Unlike traditional AI that exists purely in software, Physical AI systems:

- Perceive the physical environment through sensors
- Process information using AI algorithms
- Act on the world through actuators and motors
- Learn from physical interactions and experiences

## What You'll Learn

This documentation is organized into comprehensive modules that build your understanding from foundational concepts to advanced implementations:

### Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System

In this module, you'll explore the core communication infrastructure that enables robots to function:

1. **ROS 2 Middleware** - Understanding the modern robotics framework
2. **Nodes, Topics, Services** - Master the fundamental communication patterns
3. **Python-to-ROS Bridging via rclpy** - Learn to control robots with Python
4. **URDF for Humanoids** - Define robot structures and kinematics

<Callout type="info" title="Prerequisites">
This documentation assumes basic knowledge of:
- Programming (preferably Python)
- Command-line interface usage
- Basic understanding of robotics concepts

No prior ROS experience is required!
