# Feature Specification: Physical AI Documentation Book

**Feature Branch**: `001-physical-ai-book`
**Created**: 2025-12-03
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Intent: Create a premium, structured, Docusaurus-powered book website for the capstone topic Physical AI, beginning with Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2), and clearly explaining all four core chapters: ROS 2 Middleware, Nodes/Topics/Services, Python-to-ROS bridging via rclpy, and URDF for humanoids. Pages: Home → Intro to Physical AI + module overview + CTA; Module 1 → Scrollable MDX-based book layout with persistent sidebar and chapter navigation; About → Purpose of Physical AI + how humanoid robotics is taught; Contact → Simple form saved to localStorage. Success Criteria: Module 1 contains exactly 4 chapters, each chapter clearly structured and written in MDX; Clean book-like reading experience with persistent sidebar, smooth scroll, search, dark mode, and mobile-perfect layout; All content editable via MDX; Autogenerated navigation; Layout looks premium and polished; Fully functional Docusaurus build ready within minutes. Non-goals: Backend, auth, user accounts, payments, comment systems, simulations, or robotics code execution."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Read Module 1 Content (Priority: P1)

A learner visits the Physical AI book website to learn about ROS 2. They navigate to Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System and read through the four chapters sequentially: ROS 2 Middleware, Nodes/Topics/Services, Python-to-ROS bridging via rclpy, and URDF for humanoids. They experience a clean, book-like reading interface with a persistent sidebar showing chapter navigation, smooth scrolling between sections, and can toggle dark mode for comfortable reading in any lighting condition.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition - delivering educational content in a premium reading experience. Without this, there is no product. This MVP slice proves the concept and delivers immediate value to learners.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by navigating to Module 1, reading all four chapters, verifying sidebar persistence while scrolling, toggling dark/light mode, and confirming mobile responsiveness. Delivers standalone value as a functional e-book.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a learner visits the book homepage, **When** they click on "Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System", **Then** they see Chapter 1 (ROS 2 Middleware) content with a sidebar showing all 4 chapters
2. **Given** a learner is reading Chapter 1, **When** they scroll down the page, **Then** the sidebar remains visible and fixed on desktop screens
3. **Given** a learner clicks on Chapter 2 in the sidebar, **When** the page loads, **Then** Chapter 2 content displays with smooth transition and scroll position at top
4. **Given** a learner is on mobile device, **When** they tap the menu icon, **Then** a drawer opens showing the chapter navigation sidebar
5. **Given** a learner is reading in bright light, **When** they toggle the theme switcher, **Then** the site switches to dark mode with all content remaining readable
6. **Given** a learner completes Chapter 4, **When** they reach the end, **Then** they see pagination navigation to return to intro or explore future modules

### User Story 2 - Discover and Navigate Content (Priority: P2)

A learner lands on the homepage and wants to understand what Physical AI is and what content is available. They see an introduction to Physical AI with a clear module overview showing Module 1 is available. They can use the search functionality to find specific topics like "rclpy" or "URDF" across all content. The homepage provides a clear call-to-action to start reading Module 1.

**Why this priority**: After core reading experience (P1), discoverability is critical for user onboarding and content exploration. Search functionality enables quick access to specific topics. This can be tested independently by verifying homepage content and search without requiring Module 1 content to be complete.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by visiting the homepage, verifying intro content and module overview display correctly, using search to find keywords across pages, and clicking the CTA button to navigate to Module 1.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a learner visits the homepage for the first time, **When** the page loads, **Then** they see an introduction to Physical AI explaining what it is and why it matters
2. **Given** a learner is on the homepage, **When** they view the module overview section, **Then** they see Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System listed with a brief description and chapters count (4 chapters)
3. **Given** a learner wants to start learning, **When** they click the "Start Reading Module 1" CTA button, **Then** they navigate to Chapter 1 of Module 1
4. **Given** a learner knows they want to learn about "rclpy", **When** they type "rclpy" into the search box, **Then** they see search results showing Chapter 3: Python-to-ROS bridging via rclpy
5. **Given** a learner searches for a term not in the content, **When** no results are found, **Then** they see a helpful "No results found" message with suggestions to try different keywords

---

### User Story 3 - Learn About the Project (Priority: P3)

A learner wants to understand the purpose of the Physical AI book and the teaching methodology. They navigate to the About page which explains why humanoid robotics is taught this way and the educational philosophy behind the book structure. They can also access a Contact page where they submit questions or feedback via a simple form (data saved locally in browser).

**Why this priority**: While important for credibility and engagement, About and Contact pages are supplementary to the core learning experience. These pages can be developed after the core reading experience is proven.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by navigating to About page and verifying content display, then navigating to Contact page, filling out the form, submitting, and verifying data is saved to browser localStorage.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a learner wants to know more about the project, **When** they click "About" in the navigation, **Then** they see a page explaining the purpose of Physical AI education and teaching methodology
2. **Given** a learner wants to provide feedback, **When** they click "Contact" in the navigation, **Then** they see a contact form with fields for name, email, and message
3. **Given** a learner fills out the contact form, **When** they click Submit, **Then** the form data is saved to browser localStorage and they see a confirmation message
4. **Given** a learner has previously submitted a contact form, **When** they return to the Contact page, **Then** they can see their previous submissions listed below the form (retrieved from localStorage)

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a learner accesses the site on a very small mobile device (320px width)? The sidebar must collapse into a hamburger menu and all content must remain readable without horizontal scrolling.
- How does the system handle very long chapter content (10,000+ words)? Reading progress indicator should show scroll percentage, and page performance must remain fast (<3 second load time).
- What happens when a learner has JavaScript disabled? Core content must remain accessible and readable, with degraded functionality for search and theme switcher.
- How does the site handle accessibility needs? All content must be keyboard navigable, screen reader compatible, and meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards.
- What happens when a learner bookmarks a specific chapter? Direct chapter URLs must work and load the correct content with proper sidebar state.

- Contact form validation will be client-side only (basic email format check, required fields)
- Module 1 content will be comprehensive but concise, with each chapter estimated at 1,500-3,000 words
- Code examples in chapters will use Python and YAML syntax (for ROS 2 configuration files)
- Site will not support user comments, discussions, or collaborative features (per non-goals)
- No analytics or tracking beyond what's required for search functionality
- Site will be deployed as static files (no server-side rendering beyond build time)
