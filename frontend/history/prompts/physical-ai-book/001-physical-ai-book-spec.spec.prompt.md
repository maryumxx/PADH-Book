## Prompt

Intent

Create a premium, structured, Docusaurus-powered book-style documentation website for the capstone topic Physical AI, beginning with Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2).
The site must present a clean, book-like reading experience with a persistent sidebar, smooth scrolling, mobile-first layout, and fully MDX-editable content.

Required Pages
1. Home

Introduction to Physical AI

Overview of modules

Call-to-action for beginning the book

2. Module 1 (Book Layout)

Scrollable MDX-based book reading interface

Persistent sidebar that auto-highlights chapters

Autogenerated navigation and pagination

Exactly four chapters, detailed below

3. About

Purpose of Physical AI

Explanation of how humanoid robotics is taught

4. Contact

Simple contact form

Save form data to localStorage only (no backend)

Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

Exactly four core chapters, each written and delivered in MDX:

ROS 2 Middleware

Explain DDS, communication layers, QoS, and middleware role

Nodes, Topics, Services

Node lifecycle, publishers, subscribers, service calls, message flow

Python-to-ROS Bridging via rclpy

Writing Python nodes, timers, callbacks, executors, launch basics

URDF for Humanoids

URDF structure, joints, links, sensors, humanoid-specific modeling

Each chapter must be clearly structured, readable, and include examples, diagrams (MDX-friendly), and code blocks.

Success Criteria

Module 1 contains exactly four chapters, fully written in MDX.

Clean, premium, book-like design with persistent sidebar and smooth scroll.

Dark/light mode support.

Excellent mobile experience with responsive, polished layout.

Search enabled (Algolia or built-in).

All content editable through MDX files.

Autogenerated navigation and sidebar entries.

Fully functional Docusaurus project that can build instantly.

No backend or auth components required.

Non-Goals

Do not include:

Backend systems

Authentication or user accounts

Payments

Comment systems

Robotics simulations

Robotics code execution

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive feature specification for Physical AI Documentation Book on branch `001-physical-ai-book`.

**User Stories (3 prioritized, independently testable):**
- **P1**: Read Module 1 Content - Core reading experience with 4 chapters, persistent sidebar, dark mode, mobile responsive (MVP)
- **P2**: Discover and Navigate Content - Homepage intro, module overview, search functionality, CTA to start reading
- **P3**: Learn About the Project - About page (methodology), Contact page (localStorage form)

**Functional Requirements (25 total):**
- Content Structure (FR-001 to FR-004): Module 1 with 4 chapters in MDX, autogenerated navigation
- Navigation & Layout (FR-005 to FR-008): Persistent sidebar (desktop), drawer menu (mobile), active chapter highlighting, pagination
- User Experience (FR-009 to FR-013): Dark/light mode with persistence, smooth scrolling, scroll restoration, breadcrumbs
- Search & Discovery (FR-014 to FR-017): Content search, homepage intro, module overview, CTA button
- About & Contact (FR-018 to FR-021): About page, contact form with localStorage persistence
- Performance & Accessibility (FR-022 to FR-025): Responsive 320px-2560px, keyboard navigation, static HTML, code syntax highlighting

**Key Entities:**
- Module (title, description, number, chapters array)
- Chapter (title, number, MDX content, frontmatter, prev/next links)
- Page (static pages: Home, About, Contact)
- Contact Submission (name, email, message, timestamp - localStorage)

**Success Criteria (12 measurable, technology-agnostic):**
- SC-001: All 4 chapters readable without issues
- SC-002: Homepage loads <3s on 3G mobile
- SC-003: Responsive 320px-2560px
- SC-004: Theme toggle with persistence
- SC-005: Persistent sidebar (desktop) / drawer (mobile)
- SC-006: Search results <1s
- SC-007: Contact form saves to localStorage
- SC-008: Lighthouse Performance ≥90
- SC-009: Keyboard navigable, WCAG 2.1 AA
- SC-010: Content editable via MDX files
- SC-011: Build completes <5 minutes
- SC-012: Chapter navigation works (sidebar, pagination, breadcrumbs)

**Validation Results:**
All quality checks passed (content quality, requirement completeness, feature readiness). No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers. Zero implementation details in requirements (Docusaurus appropriately in assumptions). Ready for `/sp.plan`.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete, validated specification created for Physical AI book website with clear scope (Module 1: 4 ROS 2 chapters), prioritized user stories (P1-P3), 25 testable functional requirements, and 12 measurable success criteria. Foundation established for planning and implementation.
- 🧪 Tests: Validation checklist created and passed (14/14 checks) - no clarifications needed, all requirements testable, success criteria technology-agnostic
- 📁 Files: Created specs/001-physical-ai-book/spec.md (152 lines) and specs/001-physical-ai-book/checklists/requirements.md (checklist with validation results)
- 🔁 Next prompts:
  1. Run `/sp.plan` to create implementation architecture (project structure, Docusaurus config, component design, Module 1 content outline)
  2. After planning, run `/sp.tasks` to generate dependency-ordered task list organized by user story
  3. Optionally run `/sp.clarify` if any spec areas need refinement (currently none identified)
- 🧠 Reflection: This specification successfully balances detail with flexibility. The three-tier prioritization (P1: core reading, P2: discovery, P3: supplementary) creates a clear MVP path - implementing just P1 delivers a functional e-book. All 25 functional requirements map to acceptance scenarios, ensuring testability. Success criteria avoid implementation details (e.g., "sidebar remains visible" not "use CSS position:sticky"), which preserves architectural flexibility during planning. The 8 documented assumptions (search approach, styling framework, validation strategy, content length, syntax choices, deployment model) prevent ambiguity without requiring user clarification. Edge cases cover real-world scenarios (320px mobile, 10k word chapters, no JS, accessibility, deep links). The spec is written for educational stakeholders, not developers, maintaining proper separation of WHAT (spec) from HOW (plan). Ready for architecture phase.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None. Specification created successfully with comprehensive coverage, zero clarification markers, and all validation checks passing.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL):
  - ✅ PASS: Content Quality (no implementation details, user-focused, non-technical language, all mandatory sections complete)
  - ✅ PASS: Requirement Completeness (zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION], all testable, measurable SCs, technology-agnostic, 15 acceptance scenarios, 5 edge cases, clear scope, assumptions documented)
  - ✅ PASS: Feature Readiness (all FRs have acceptance criteria, user scenarios cover flows, measurable outcomes, no implementation leakage)
  - ✅ PASS: Branch creation (001-physical-ai-book created and checked out)
  - ✅ PASS: Directory structure (specs/001-physical-ai-book/ with spec.md and checklists/)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A (standard /sp.specify workflow)
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Monitor whether the documented assumptions (especially search implementation choice and content length estimates) hold true during planning phase, or if they require adjustment based on Docusaurus capabilities
