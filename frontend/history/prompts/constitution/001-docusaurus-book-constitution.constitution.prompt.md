## Prompt
I want you to architect and build a full book-style documentation website using Docusaurus (latest version). The website should handle UI, routing, theming, sidebar, and layout entirely via Docusaurus, while the content structure follows a clean, scalable, book-like organization.

Requirements:

Content Structure:

Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

Chapters:

ROS middleware

Nodes, topics, and services

Python-to-ROS bridging with rclpy

URDF for humanoids

Each chapter must be written in MDX, supporting reusable components and custom React components.

Docusaurus Features:

Autogenerated sidebars

Dark/light mode toggle

Persistent sidebar with mobile drawer navigation

Doc pagination

Built-in or Algolia search

SEO metadata

Analytics support

Scroll restoration

Keyboard navigation

Print-friendly styles

Reading progress indicators

Copy buttons for code blocks

Versioning-ready structure for future modules

Design Guidelines:

Clean, minimal, fast, readable

Mobile-first, responsive layout

Sidebar remains persistent while chapters load in the main reading panel

Project Constitution:

Full folder structure for docs, MDX files, components, theme, static assets, and plugins

Sidebar configuration

MDX organization strategy

Theming guidelines

Plugin setup for performance optimization

Explanation of how all pieces work together in Docusaurus ecosystem

Output:
Provide a complete project constitution including all configurations, folder structure, MDX files, reusable components, theming, plugin setups, and a clear explanation of the system workflow. The architecture should support future modules and expansions seamlessly.



## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive constitution (v1.0.0) for Docusaurus-based book documentation with 8 core principles:

**I. Docusaurus-First Architecture** - All UI/routing/theming handled by Docusaurus, no custom frameworks
**II. Book-Like Content Organization** - Hierarchical module-chapter-section structure, flat file layout within modules
**III. Mobile-First, Reading-Optimized Design** - 16px+ fonts, 75ch max width, drawer nav, progress indicators
**IV. Performance & Progressive Enhancement** - SSG, <3s load on 3G, Lighthouse ≥90, works without JS
**V. Component Reusability & MDX Integration** - Global MDX components (Callout, ReadingProgress, VideoEmbed, etc.)
**VI. SEO & Discoverability** - Frontmatter metadata, Open Graph tags, JSON-LD, sitemap
**VII. Versioning & Future-Proofing** - Docusaurus versioning plugin support, semantic versioning structure
**VIII. Analytics & Continuous Improvement** - GA4/Plausible tracking, privacy-first, data-driven content updates

Constitution includes complete:
- Project structure (docs/, src/components/, src/theme/, static/)
- Docusaurus config patterns (sidebars.js, docusaurus.config.js)
- Plugin recommendations (@docusaurus/plugin-pwa, image-zoom, local search)
- Theme customization (CSS variables, print styles, color modes)
- Component implementation examples (ReadingProgress with code)
- MDX authoring rules and content standards
- Development workflow and deployment guidelines
- Governance and amendment process

Ready for implementation with Module 1: Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2) chapters.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Established complete architectural foundation for Docusaurus book documentation project with 8 comprehensive principles covering architecture, content organization, UX, performance, components, SEO, versioning, and analytics
- 🧪 Tests: N/A (constitution is governance document, not executable code)
- 📁 Files: Created/updated `.specify/memory/constitution.md` (637 lines, version 1.0.0)
- 🔁 Next prompts:
  1. Initialize Docusaurus project structure following constitution
  2. Create Module 1: Robotic Nervous System chapters (01-ros-middleware.mdx through 04-urdf-humanoids.mdx)
  3. Implement custom React components (Callout, ReadingProgress, VideoEmbed)
  4. Configure sidebars.js and docusaurus.config.js per constitution specs
  5. Set up theme customization and print styles
- 🧠 Reflection: This constitution successfully translates the user's comprehensive requirements into a structured, enforceable governance document. The 8 principles are declarative, testable, and cover all major concerns: technology lock-in prevention (Docusaurus-first), scalability (book structure), accessibility (mobile-first), performance (measurable metrics), developer experience (MDX components), discoverability (SEO), maintenance (versioning), and improvement (analytics). The technical architecture section provides concrete implementation patterns rather than abstract guidance. The document is future-proof with versioning support and clear amendment process.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None. Constitution successfully created with all placeholders filled, sync impact report included, and comprehensive coverage of user requirements.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL):
  - ✅ PASS: No unexplained bracket tokens remaining
  - ✅ PASS: Version (1.0.0) and dates (2025-12-03) properly formatted
  - ✅ PASS: All 8 principles are declarative and testable
  - ✅ PASS: Sync impact report included at top of file
  - ✅ PASS: Templates compatibility verified (plan, spec, tasks all compatible)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A (initial constitution creation)
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Validate constitution principles during actual Docusaurus project initialization to ensure all technical specifications are implementable as written
